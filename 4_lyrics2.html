        Yeah
        Everybody knows that I'm breaking down
        Everybody knows I ain't fakin' now
        Everybody knows my heart's vacant now
        Yeah, she hates me now, I made mistakes, but now
        I don't ever wanna be alone, I don't really ever feel at home
        On my own, in the zone


        That's the only way I know, feelin' low
        'Bout to blow back up, here I go
        I will never let the doubt creep in
        Gotta pop a couple more Aspirin
        I don't think I'll ever let you in
        Easier to break it off as friends
        I don't really understand myself
        I don't really understand, need help
        I don't wanna be left on the shelf
        Couldn't even hear me if I yelled


        It's so cold outside
        I'm alone, I'm alright
        It's so cold outside
        I'm alone, I'm alright


        Yeah, let's go
        I don't wanna break down, always feel like I could break now
        But I never let it take me to that place now
        I won't ever let my thoughts get away now
        I got better things to do, picking fate now
        I just wanna be the best, call me great now
        I don't know if I'm okay or insane now
        I remember better days on the playground

        
        Hoping I can find my way to a better place now
        Even when I'm feeling down, I fight
        Even when I don't know what is right
        I'ma pick a side, and I'ma take pride
        I will decide my fate and I
        Will never let them tell me who I am
        If you try to shape me, I'll be damned
        Planted on the ground is where I stand
        Never give up, that was always the plan


        It's so cold outside
        I'm alone, I'm alright
        It's so cold outside
        I'm alone, I'm alright
